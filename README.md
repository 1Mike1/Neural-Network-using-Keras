# Neural-Network-using-Keras
Building Neural Network using Keras for customer classification.

# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
An artificial neural network is an attempt to simulate the network of neurons that make up a human brain so that the computer will be able to learn things and make decisions in a humanlike manner. ANNs are created by programming regular computers to behave as though they are interconnected brain cells.

# Binary Classifications
Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups (predicting which group each one belongs to) on the basis of a classification rule.

# What is Keras?
Keras is a high-level neural network API which is written in Python and it wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.

Keras can be used as a deep learning library because it also support Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks

For binary classification we are using Bank Customers data.
There are 10000 observations with 13 input variables and 1 output variable. Using this dataset we will build a model which will predict whether the customer will leave the bank or not.
